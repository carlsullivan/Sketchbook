		<h4 id="location-bodyhead"> Fonts</h4>
			<body>I recently started making my own hand drawn typography fonts. I am working on the process of making these avaialable online. Until then please check out my work when you can.</body>
		
		<h4 id="location-bodyhead"> Doodles</h4>
			<body> These are things that I draw when just working through this world. Wether I drew them while not paying attention in math class, or just for kicks and giggles, they are fun to work on and always inspire new ideas.</body>
		
		<h4 id="location-bodyhead"> Logo Design</h4>
			<body>Logo design has been around for ages, but what makes a good logo is that it points directly to your company/brand/apartment? I would love to hear more about what you are trying to do and work with you to design a logo that you will want to put on EVERYTHING!</body>
